# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to present my notes, so that were publicly accessible, and the information was easy to find and read.
- I built this project because readi8ng notes can only help you learn so much. The proccess of creating this project helped reinforced all the information compiled in the webpage. 
- It allows people to access this information on the internet rather than have it be limited to local access.
- I learned all the basic steps for creating a webpage including, a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScriipt. 

## Installation

First I had to create a github repository, and link it to my local drive.
From there, I had to build an HTML doc to create a framework for my webpage. After that, I added a css style sheet and linked it to my HTML. The next step was to create a JavaScript doc and link it to my HTML file.

## Usage

To use this prework study guide, you can read through the information in each section. For a suggestion on which part to read first you can open the chrome Devtools. A console panel should open and there yoy will find a list of the topics in the study guide as well as a suggestion on which to study first.
